        <h1>What are some solutions to global warming</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>End reliance on fossil fuels-We must replace coal, oil, and gas with renewable and efficient energy sources.</li>
                <li>Greater energy effiencey-energy efficiency strategies can be applied across multiple sectors: in our power plants, electrical grids, factories, vehicles, buildings, home appliances, and more. Some of these climate-friendly strategies can be enormously complex, such as helping utility companies adopt performance-based regulation systems, in which they no longer make more money simply by selling more energy but rather by improving the services they provide.</li>
                <li>renewable energy-wind energy,Hydroelectric power,Biomass energy,Geothermal energy,Ocean energy,Solar power,Geothermal heat pumps,Small wind systems,Selling the energy you collect,</li>
