        <h1>What causes global warming?</h1>
        <p> Global warming results from the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases that trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere. This trapped energy comes from incoming solar radiation absorbed by the earth’s surface and re-radiated back into the atmosphere as infrared energy.</p>
        <p>Though natural cycles and fluctuations have caused the planet's climate to change continually over the last 800,000 years, it is human activity that has driven our current era of global warming. In particular, our burning of fossil fuels—such as coal, oil, gasoline, and natural gas—has led to the greenhouse effect. In the United States, the largest source of greenhouse gases is transportation, followed closely by electricity production and industrial activity</p>
        <h1>Some causes of global warming</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Generating power-Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas causes a large chunk of global emissions. Most electricity is still produced from fossil fuels.</li>
            <li>Manufacturing goods-Manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothes, and other goods. Mining and other industrial processes also release gases.</li>
            <li>Cutting down forests-Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when they are cut, release the carbon they have been storing. Since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits nature’s ability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Using transportation-Most cars, trucks, ships, and planes run on fossil fuels. That makes transportation a major contributor of greenhouse gases, especially carbon-dioxide emissions. Road vehicles account for the largest part, but emissions from ships and planes continue to grow.</li>
            <li>Producing food-Producing food requires energy to run farm equipment or fishing boats, usually with fossil fuels. Growing crops can also cause emissions, like when using fertilizers and manure. Cattle produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. And emissions also come from packaging and distributing food.</li>
            <li>Powering buildings-Globally, residential and commercial buildings consume over half of all electricity. As they continue to draw on coal, oil, and natural gas for heating and cooling, they emit significant quantities of greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
            <li>Consuming too much-Your home and use of power, how you move around, what you eat, and how much you throw away all contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. So does the consumption of goods such as clothing, electronics, and plastics.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Some direct causes of global warming</h1>
        <p>Greenhouse gases as they trap heat into the athmosphere below are some of them</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Carbon dioxide comes from Fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, cement production.</li>
                <li>Methane comes from Agriculture (enteric fermentation in livestock), landfills, oil & gas leaks.</li>
                <li>Nitrous oxide comes from Fertilizers, industrial processes, sewage treatment.</li>
                <li>Flourintated gases comes from efrigerants, solvents, industrial uses.</li>
            </ul>
